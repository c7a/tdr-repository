# tdr-repository
Tool to set up filesystems which will be used for the TDR file repository.

Many tools read a configuration file from **/etc/canadiana/tdr/tdr.conf** to read their configuration.  This tool reads that file in order to manage the **/repository** dirctory that is used by tools run on the TDR file repository nodes (including the public facing content and image services).

We will be adding more documentation for the format of the file and related directories soon.
